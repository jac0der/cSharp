1. Run a loop from number 1 to 100.

2. Check with a conditional if each number is divisible both
   3 and 5, if is yes, print "FizzBuzz".

3. Check with a condition if each number is divisible by 3. 
   If a number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz".
    
4. Check with a condition if each number is divisible by 5. 
   If a number is divisible by 5, print "Buzz".

The modulo operator (%) was used to check if a number is divisible 
by 3 and 5.
For example: 25 % 5 == 0, therefore 25 is divisible by 5.

The is_multiple function was defined to accept any number as dividend 
as well as the divisor to be used to check if divisor is
a multiple of dividend. true is returned if divisor is a multiple of
dividend, otherwise false is returned.

The is_multiple function is subsequently used in the multiple test cases.

The numbers from 1 to 100 was achieved by using a for loop, initializing
variable i to 1, going up to and including 100 with <=, then incrementing
counter variable i by 1 (i++) on each loop itertation.
