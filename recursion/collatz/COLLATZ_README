The Collatz conjecture applies to positive integers and speculates that it
is always possible to get "back to 1" if you follow these steps:

    1. If n is 1, stop
    2. Otherwise, if n is even, repeat this process on n/2
    3. Otherwise, if n is odd, repeat this process on 3n + 1

Write a recursive function collatz(n) that calculates how many 
steps it takes to get to 1 if you start from n and recurse as 
indicated above.
