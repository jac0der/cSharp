1. import the namespace for c# arbitray-precision arithmetic datatypes
   to be able to use the BigInteger datatype to ensure the factorial program
   is capable of handling the factorial result of large numbers.
   
   using System.Numerics;

2. accept input from user.
    - use a do...while() loop to keep prompting user for a valid numeric input
    - input must be a positive whole number, otherwise re-prompt user for input
    - input must be of numeric format, otherwise re-prompt user for input

3. pass valid user input to the factorial method to calculate the factorial
   of valid number entered by user.

   factorial method return data type is BigInteger, so program can handle results
   that int or long datatypes cannot handle, so preventing integer or lon overflow.

4. display result in scientific notation with the e+157 format if result of factorial
   is greater than the upper bound value of a long data type, otherwise, just display
   the result.
